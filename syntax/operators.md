# Operators

The operators in javascript in order of precedence are as follows:

* () : Used to denote grouping in operations
* . : Denotes member of (class.member)
* [] : 
* Denotes member of (class["member"])
* ?. : Optional chaining operator
* () : function call parentheses
* new : Memoy allocation
* ++ : Increment operator. Increases numeric values and strings by 1
* -- : Decrement operator. Decreases numeric values and strings by 1
* ! : Logical not operator
* ~ : bitwise not operator
*  ** : The exponent operator returns the right operator to the left operators power, and applies the same principals as multiplication.
* \* : Multiplies operands of numeric nature, or numeric strings. Other string multiplications return zero. Null acts as zero.
*  / : Divides left operand by left. Operates under same conditions as multiplications, which means that having a null right operand throws a divide by zero error.
* \+ : Addition operator. Adds two operands. Will add integers, floats, strings, null together, and any combination thereof.
*  \- : Subtracts right from left operand. Will work normally on numeric data. If two numeric strings are passed, the data is implicitly converted to required dtype before subtracting. Returns null on other string subtractions. Also returns null for null on null subtraction or numeric value for null subtracted from numeric data.
* << : Shift left operator
* \>> : Right shift operator, for sign bit included
* \>>> : Right shift, sign bit excluded.
* in : used to denote property of an object
* < : Compares if a is less than b for a < b
* <= : Compares if a is less than or equal to b for a <= b
* \> : Compares if a is greater than b for a > b
* \>= : Compares if a is greater than or equal to b for a > b
* == : Checks if a and b are equal
* != : Checks if a and b are not equal
* & : Bitwise and
* ^ : Bitwise xor
* | : Bitwise or
* && : Logical And
* || : Logical Or
* ? : Ternary operator {Syntax = (condition)?(Yes):(No)}
* Assignment  (=) : Assigns a value to the left operand



The typeof operator is useful to determine the type of a given variable
