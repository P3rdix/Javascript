# Javascript



## Introduction

​	 This repo is an introduction to the javascript programming language. Javascript, in addition to HTML and CSS, is one of the most commonly used programming languages used for web-design. It is used mainly by embedding the code into a .html file, or by creating a .js file and linking it to the required HTML file using the script tag's source attribute.

​	 While, unlike classical languages, it is not necessary for one to use semi colons in javascript, it is heavily recommended as it is the most often used industry standard, and makes the code much more readable. Furthermore, comments are also highly recommended, and can be used in the same syntax as c and c++, i.e., with // for single line comments, and /**/ for multiline comments.

​	Javascript does not require a compiler; it was deigned to run on a web browser, and therefore will work on any device containing one. One may, if they so desire, choose to use online compilers and editors to run their designs. Many sites , such as scrimba and freecodecamp.org provide this facility.

​	The following folders cover the topics given below:
